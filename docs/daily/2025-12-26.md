# 2025-12-26a

## Today's Goals

- Set up complete project structure for Mario RL Agent
- Configure development environment and documentation system
- Get Git/GitHub workflow established

## What I Accomplished

- [x] Created full project directory structure with Poetry ✅ 2025-12-26
- [x] Initialized Git repository and connected to GitHub ✅ 2025-12-26
- [x] Set up comprehensive project documentation using Obsidian.nvim ✅ 2025-12-26
- [x] Configured floating terminal in Neovim with toggleterm ✅ 2025-12-26
- [x] Created project documentation with full architecture and implementation phases ✅ 2025-12-26
- [x] Set up daily note template system ✅ 2025-12-26
- [x] Resolved multiple Neovim plugin configurations ✅ 2025-12-26

## What I Learned

- Poetry dependency management and project initialization
- Advanced Git workflows (init, remote setup, pushing to GitHub)
- Programmatic file creation with `find` command and `-exec` flag
- Neovim plugin configuration (lazy loading, keybindings, dependencies)
- Obsidian.nvim wiki-style linking and daily notes
- LSP vs linter diagnostics and how they interact
- Markdown preview in Neovim with browser rendering

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge**: Created nested Neovim instance when running `nvim` from terminal buffer
- **Solution**: Use `:e filename` to edit files directly instead of opening new nvim instance

- **Challenge**: Toggleterm wouldn't load/activate with default keybinds
- **Solution**: Changed keybind to `<leader>fk` and added proper lazy-loading configuration

- **Challenge**: Obsidian.nvim missing nvim-cmp dependency (LazyVim uses blink.cmp instead)
- **Solution**: Set `nvim_cmp = false` in obsidian completion config

- **Challenge**: Persistent markdown line-length warnings from multiple sources
- **Solution**: Disabled diagnostics for markdown entirely via autocmds, disabled marksman LSP, and cleared nvim-lint for markdown files

- **Challenge**: Accidentally created directories in wrong locations (~/mlp vs /mlp, literal `~` folder)
- **Solution**: Learned importance of relative vs absolute paths; used `.` for current directory

## Tomorrow's Focus

- Begin Phase 1: Environment Setup
- Install core ML dependencies (PyTorch, Gymnasium, gym-super-mario-bros)
- Set up Python virtual environment with Poetry
- Initialize PostgreSQL database for experiment tracking
- Create first exploration notebook

## Links & Context

- [[ProjectDocumentation]] - Full project architecture and phases
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BrendonJL/mlp)
- Project root: ~/mlp/

## Code/Commands Used

```bash
# Project setup
mkdir ~/mlp && cd ~/mlp
poetry init
git init
gh repo create

# Programmatic .gitkeep creation
find . -type d -empty -exec touch {}/.gitkeep \;

# Curl Python .gitignore template
curl -Lo .gitignore https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/python

# Git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git push origin main
```

## Notes

This was an incredibly productive setup day! The project structure is solid and follows ML best practices. The workflow between Neovim, Git, and documentation is now smooth. Really excited to start the actual ML work tomorrow.

Key takeaway: Taking time to set up proper tooling and documentation upfront will pay dividends as the project grows in complexity. The hybrid approach of using Neovim for editing with the option to visualize in Obsidian app gives best of both worlds.
