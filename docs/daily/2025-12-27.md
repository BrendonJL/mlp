# 2025-12-27a

## Today's Goals

- Install core Python dependencies with Poetry
- Set up development environment for ML project
- Configure instructional interaction style with Claude Code

## What I Accomplished

- [x] Added "Interaction Style" section to CLAUDE.md for instructional learning approach ✅ 2025-12
      -27
- [x] Configured .gitignore to exclude Obsidian plugin data and sensitive files ✅ 2025-12-27
- [x] Fixed Python version constraint in pyproject.toml (>=3.14,<3.15) ✅ 2025-12-27
- [x] Installed core ML dependencies: PyTorch (2.9.1), Gymnasium, gym-super-mario-bros ✅ 2025-12-2
      7
- [x] Installed dev dependencies: pytest, black, ruff ✅ 2025-12-27
- [x] Verified PyTorch installation and virtual environment setup ✅ 2025-12-27
- [x] Committed clean project state to GitHub ✅ 2025-12-27

## What I Learned

- **Git Security**: API keys and secrets must never go in version control; learned to use .gitignor
  e and git reset to clean commit history
- **Gitignore Formatting**: Entries must have NO leading whitespace or they won't work
- **Poetry Dependency Management**: Two-step process of `poetry add` (declare) then `poetry install
` (install)
- **Version Constraints**:
  - `^` notation means "compatible version" (^9.0.2 = >=9.0.2,<10.0.0)
  - Semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  - Prevents breaking changes while allowing improvements
- **Poetry 2.0 Changes**: `poetry shell` replaced with `poetry env activate` or `poetry run`
- **Virtual Environments**: Must activate environment or use `poetry run` to access installed packa
  ges
- **Lock Files**: `poetry.lock` pins exact versions for reproducibility across environments

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge**: Almost committed Obsidian plugin data with API key to GitHub
- **Solution**: Blocked by git hook; learned to properly configure .gitignore and used `git reset`
  to clean commit history before pushing

- **Challenge**: .gitignore entries not working - Obsidian files still being staged
- **Solution**: Discovered leading whitespace breaks .gitignore patterns; removed all indentation f
  rom ignore rules

- **Challenge**: Poetry dependency resolution failed - PyTorch's triton dependency incompatible wit
  h Python >=3.15
- **Solution**: Changed `requires-python` from ">=3.14" to ">=3.14,<3.15" to match ecosystem constr
  aints

- **Challenge**: `poetry shell` command not found in Poetry 2.0
- **Solution**: Used `source` command from `poetry env activate` output to manually activate virtua
  l environment

- **Challenge**: `import torch` failed with ModuleNotFoundError
- **Solution**: Realized I hadn't actually activated the virtual environment - needed to run the `source` command first

## Tomorrow's Focus

- Continue Phase 1: Environment Setup
- Initialize PostgreSQL database for experiment tracking
- Create database schema for experiments
- Set up Weights & Biases account and project
- Begin exploring gym-super-mario-bros environment

## Links & Context

- [[ProjectDocumentation]] - Updated Phase 1 progress
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BrendonJL/mlp)
- Virtual environment location: `~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/mario-rl-agent-Wy1Nlkde-py3.14/`

## Code/Commands Used

```bash
# Fix git commit with sensitive data
git reset --soft HEAD~2
git add .
git commit -m "Add project documentation and CLAUDE.md interaction style"
git push

# Poetry dependency management
poetry add torch gymnasium gym-super-mario-bros
poetry add --group dev pytest black ruff

# Virtual environment activation (Poetry 2.0)
poetry env activate  # Shows activation command
source /home/blasley/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/mario-rl-agent-Wy1Nlkde-py3.14/bin/activate

# Verify PyTorch
python
>>> import torch
>>> print(torch.__version__)  # 2.9.1+cu128

## Notes

Productive day setting up the Python environment! The git workflow challenge with the API key was a valuable lesson in security practices. Understanding Poetry's dependency management and version constraints will be crucial as the project grows. The PyTorch installation took ~43 minutes but verified successfully with CUDA support (cu128). Ready to move into database setup and environment exploration tomorrow.

Key insight: Taking time to properly configure tooling (CLAUDE.md interaction style, .gitignore, dependency constraints) prevents problems down the road.

The `2025-12-27` placeholder will be automatically filled by obsidian.nvim when you create a daily note.
