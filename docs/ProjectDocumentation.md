# Mario RL Agent - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project represents my first hands-on exploration of machine learning through applied practice. Rather than starting with pure theory, I'm building a reinforcement learning agent that can learn to play Super Mario Bros. This practical approach will teach me fundamental ML concepts including neural networks, training pipelines, experiment tracking, and model evaluation—all while working on an engaging, tangible problem.

The ultimate goal extends beyond Mario: I'm building skills and establishing workflows that will transfer to my career goal of applying machine learning to cybersecurity applications, specifically around Suricata rule generation and intelligent incident reporting.

### Phase 2: Baseline Agent ✅ COMPLETE (Dec 30-31, 2025)

- [x] Install and test gym-super-mario-bros environment ✅ 2025-12-30
- [x] Implement random agent to understand environment mechanics ✅ 2025-12-31
- [x] Build frame preprocessing pipeline: ✅ 2025-12-31
  - [x] Grayscale conversion ✅ 2025-12-31
  - [x] Frame resizing ✅ 2025-12-31
  - [x] Frame stacking (temporal context) ✅ 2025-12-31
  - [x] Normalization ✅ 2025-12-31
- [x] Create first Jupyter notebook for environment exploration ✅ 2025-12-31
- [x] Log baseline experiment to Weights & Biases ✅ 2025-12-31
- [x] Enhanced baseline with 13 comprehensive metrics ✅ 2025-12-31
- [x] Database schema migration for episode metrics ✅ 2025-12-31
- [~] Record and save gameplay videos ⚠️ Deferred (see note below)

**Phase 2 Achievements:**
- Random baseline: avg reward ~380, max x_pos 434, 0/10 level completions
- Enhanced metrics: 13 tracked values (x_pos, score, time, coins, life, status, flag_get, etc.)
- wandb cloud integration with authentication and real-time logging
- PostgreSQL schema extended with 8 new episode metric columns
- Success criteria defined: x_pos > 434, score ≥ 100, flag_get = True

**Video Recording Note:**
Attempted multiple approaches (RecordVideo wrapper, manual imageio frame collection) but discovered gym-super-mario-bros has render_mode='rgb_array' compatibility issues (unmaintained since 2019). Videos created but contain static frames. **Decision: Proceed with metrics-only approach.** Comprehensive wandb tracking provides sufficient baseline proof. Video recording deferred to Phase 3 with alternative approach (render_mode='human' + screen recording).
