# Mario RL Agent - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project represents my first hands-on exploration of machine learning through applied practice. Rather than starting with pure theory, I'm building a reinforcement learning agent that can learn to play Super Mario Bros. This practical approach will teach me fundamental ML concepts including neural networks, training pipelines, experiment tracking, and model evaluation—all while working on an engaging, tangible problem.

The ultimate goal extends beyond Mario: I'm building skills and establishing workflows that will transfer to my career goal of applying machine learning to cybersecurity applications, specifically around Suricata rule generation and intelligent incident reporting.
