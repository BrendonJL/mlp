# Mario RL Agent - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project represents my first hands-on exploration of machine learning through applied practice. Rather than starting with pure theory, I'm building a reinforcement learning agent that can learn to play Super Mario Bros. This practical approach will teach me fundamental ML concepts including neural networks, training pipelines, experiment tracking, and model evaluation—all while working on an engaging, tangible problem.

The ultimate goal extends beyond Mario: I'm building skills and establishing workflows that will transfer to my career goal of applying machine learning to cybersecurity applications, specifically around Suricata rule generation and intelligent incident reporting.

- [x] Database schema migration for episode metrics ✅ 2025-12-31
- [~] Record and save gameplay videos ⚠️ Deferred (see note below)

**Phase 2 Achievements:**
- Random baseline: avg reward ~380, max x_pos 434, 0/10 level completions
- Enhanced metrics: 13 tracked values (x_pos, score, time, coins, life, status, flag_get, etc.)
- wandb cloud integration with authentication and real-time logging
- PostgreSQL schema extended with 8 new episode metric columns
- Success criteria defined: x_pos > 434, score ≥ 100, flag_get = True

**Video Recording Note:**
Attempted multiple approaches (RecordVideo wrapper, manual imageio frame collection) but discovered gym-super-mario-bros has render_mode='rgb_array' compatibility issues (unmaintained since 2019). Videos created but contain static frames. **Decision: Proceed with metrics-only approach.** Comprehensive wandb tracking provides sufficient baseline proof. Video recording deferred to Phase 3 with alternative approach (render_mode='human' + screen recording).

- `src/utils/config_loader.py` - YAML configuration loader
- `src/environments/mario_env.py` - Environment helper with simplified actions + CompatibilityWrapper
- `src/environments/wrappers.py` - 5 custom wrappers (Compatibility, Grayscale, Resize, FrameStack, Transpose)
- `src/utils/db_logger.py` - Database logging with connection pooling (5 functions) + metadata tracking
- `src/training/train.py` - Complete training orchestrator with git/version metadata tracking
- `src/training/callbacks.py` - Custom WandbCallback and DatabaseCallback
- `scripts/evaluate_model.py` - Model evaluation script with rendering and statistics ✅ 2026-01-04
- `scripts/random_agent.py` - Updated with database logging ✅ 2026-01-04
- `notebooks/02_baseline_vs_dqn_comparison.ipynb` - Comprehensive analysis notebook ✅ 2026-01-04
- `data/videos/dqn_baseline_evaluation_2026-01-04.mp4` - Trained agent gameplay video ✅ 2026-01-04
- Successful 2M timestep training run (785 episodes, ~12 hours) ✅ 2026-01-03

**Phase 3 Results:**
- **DQN Performance**: 5.33x better reward (360 → 1920), 2.92x further distance (350 → 1024 pixels), 14.76x better score (40 → 590)
- **Training Success**: Agent learned meaningful strategies (rightward movement, enemy interaction, coin collection)
- **Database**: 785 training episodes + 10 baseline episodes logged with 13 comprehensive metrics each
- **Analysis**: Full comparative analysis in Jupyter notebook with interactive visualizations
- **Evaluation**: Working evaluation pipeline with video recording capability

**Key Learnings:**
- DQN fundamentals: Q-function, Bellman equation, bootstrapping, experience replay, target networks
- YAML configuration management for reproducible experiments
- Database connection pooling with defensive programming and type safety
- Simplified action space: SIMPLE_MOVEMENT provides 7 useful actions vs 256 button combinations
- Stable-Baselines3 integration: CnnPolicy, hyperparameter passing, model.learn() API
- Callback pattern: Event hooks for logging during training without modifying SB3 code
- Training pipeline architecture: Orchestrator pattern coordinating config, wandb, database, environment, agent, callbacks
- **Wrapper composition pattern**: Build complex preprocessing from simple, single-purpose wrappers
- **Image format conventions**: PyTorch uses (C,H,W), NumPy/TensorFlow use (H,W,C) - TransposeWrapper bridges gap
- **API compatibility strategies**: CompatibilityWrapper bridges old Gym and new Gymnasium APIs with try/except fallback
- **Metadata tracking for reproducibility**: Git hash, Python version, PyTorch version logged to database
- **Systematic debugging**: Fixed 29 total integration issues (16 training, 13 evaluation) across multiple system boundaries
- **Real ML engineering**: Integration debugging is 50% of the job - tutorials skip this critical skill!
- **Integration testing principles**: Tests must exercise full code paths - 1000 steps missed bugs, 30k steps found them all
- **Type system boundaries**: NumPy → Python → PostgreSQL require explicit type conversions at integration points
- **Schema evolution challenges**: Code and database naming must stay synchronized across phases
- **Process management**: Long-running training requires protection from system power management (hypridle, suspend)
- **Evaluation best practices**: deterministic=False allows stochastic policy with exploration, often performs better than deterministic=True
- **Data analysis workflow**: PostgreSQL → Pandas → Plotly pipeline for comprehensive experiment analysis
- **Partial learning in RL**: Agents can improve significantly (5x reward) without completing the task (0% success rate)
- **Visualization impact**: Interactive plots (Plotly) reveal learning curves and performance trends missed by raw statistics

### Phase 4: PPO Baseline & Comparison 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Jan 10, 2026)

- [x] Learn PPO concepts (on-policy, actor-critic, advantage estimation) ✅ 2026-01-10
- [x] Create PPO configuration file (`configs/ppo_baseline.yaml`) ✅ 2026-01-10
- [x] Update training script to support multiple algorithms ✅ 2026-01-10
- [x] Implement vectorized environment wrapper (`src/environments/vec_mario_env.py`) ✅ 2026-01-10
- [x] Add SubprocVecEnv for parallel environment execution (8 envs) ✅ 2026-01-10

- [ ] Run full PPO training (2M timesteps) 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Compare PPO vs DQN performance (same timesteps, different algorithms)
- [ ] Create comparison notebook with visualizations
- [ ] Document PPO vs DQN learnings

**Phase 4 Progress: 6/10 tasks complete (60%)**

**Completed Artifacts:**
- `configs/ppo_baseline.yaml` - PPO experiment configuration (8 parallel envs, 1024 n_steps)
- `src/environments/vec_mario_env.py` - Vectorized environment wrapper using SubprocVecEnv
- `src/training/train.py` - Updated with multi-algorithm support (PPO + DQN)

**Key Learnings (so far):**
- **PPO vs DQN architecture**: On-policy (fresh data) vs off-policy (replay buffer)
- **Actor-critic**: PPO learns policy + value function; advantage = Q(s,a) - V(s)
- **Parallel environments**: SubprocVecEnv enables true multiprocessing parallelism
- **CPU utilization sweet spot**: 8 envs at 82-95% CPU - leaves headroom for gradient updates
- **PPO training metrics**: approx_kl, clip_fraction, explained_variance indicate training health
